# The Challenge
In our Materials Marketplace we have many different companies all looking for the same material. However, each company is looking for a specific quantity of the material at a price they set themselves. A company approaches our team with a large amount of that material, but not enough to complete every request for it. Given the total amount of the material they have, the company asks us to find out what companies they should sell to in order to maximize their profits. This scenario happens

frequently so we need to be able to compute the answer relatively quickly and with minimal processing power.
